We hope you can make the workshop on Saturday 15th October. To get you thinking about the topic, please reply with answers to one of the questions below, by 6pm on Wednesday 12th October.

    Have you ever used web fonts in a project?
    If you answered yes, what method did you use to deliver those fonts?

When you reply to this message, we'll update your RSVP to Yes. If you don't reply to this message by 6pm on Friday 7th October, we'll update your RSVP to No. Eep!

Regards,

Justin & Steve
